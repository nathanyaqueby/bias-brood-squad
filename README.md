# Metasabio
Submission for Artificially Correct Hackathon by Bias Brood Squad.<br>
Metasabio is a small search engine that retrieves metadata/description from [SABIO dataset](https://github.com/valevo/artificially_correct_challenge) using cosine similarity and TF-IDF weighting.

## Background
The [Cultural AI Lab](https://www.cultural-ai.nl/) in collaboration with the [National Museum of World Cultures (NMvW)](https://collectie.wereldculturen.nl/) have been developing SABIO (the SociAl BIas Observatory): a tool and visual interface for exploratory analysis of bias and patterns of bias in museum collections and heritage archives. SABIO emphasises that researching bias is a social act and therefore, instead of automatically detecting [and judging] potential instances of bias, it is designed to provide access to paths through cultural datasets that lead users to discover bias in ways they might not [be able to] anticipate. To this end, SABIO consists of an extensible suite of parameterised algorithms that measure variables likely to correlate with bias and (re-)orginasises the given collection according to these measurements and provides details about the origin individual values.
